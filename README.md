# NearBot
Versatile robotic actuator triggered by proximity to user's paired phone that can move something such as a button, switch, or dial on various devices when you (with your phone (in hotspot mode) or a beacon in your pocket) are nearby. This means it could automatically unlock and re-lock a door latch as *only you* pass by, shut off a sprinkler valve so you can pass through the water unscathed like a sort of suburban Moses, lower speaker volume while you are in the garage band room, trigger a iPod playing a dramatic entry tune or tell a joke (Jaden Smith tweet?) while you are in the room, or pause a movie when you get up to use the restroom.

Somewhat jittery, and only reliable between 1 - 3 meters.
